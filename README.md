# API-and-Databases
Here I work with some simple databases and APIs. 

This is the first time I tried to hookup an db with an API... It's actually the first time for me creating a database too

My most recent project was the ebay_bot. It looks through the best matches for your search
and if the price matches your threshhold it'll send you an email with the link to that object. You can also print out the top 5 matches for 
your search keyword.
