# API-and-Databases
Here I work with some simple databases and APIs. 

This repository was a little outdated. So I deleted some older stuff which didn't really serve any purpose. 

My most recent project was the ebay_bot. It looks through the best matches for your search
and if the price matches your threshhold it'll send you an email with the link to that object. You can also print out the top 5 matches for 
your search keyword.
